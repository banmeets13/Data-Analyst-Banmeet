## **Project 1 -> Descriptive Analysis**

## **Project Description**: Descriptive Analysis of predicting the exact class the phones.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Project Title: Classifying the phones into different price ranges at the burgeoning mobile company.**


**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of different mobile phone prices in the competitive market for burgeoning mobile. Through this analysis, we aim to summarize key features that determine the price and category (High-3, Medium-2, Low-1) of the mobile phones, indicating how high the price is so that the company can identify trends and generate insights that can inform marketing strategies and inventory management.

üìä **Key Analysis Techniques/Methodology**

1-	Data Collection and Preparation:

   o	Loading and uploading of the dataset- It was done through the Google Collab platform(Jupyter) and Microsoft Excel.

   o	Performed the data describe, understanding  the column data types and whole structure of the table.

   o	Performed data cleaning operations to address missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.

   o	Perform data outliers and missing value treatment on the dataset through IQR method and mean, mode replacement methods.

  o	Calculate summary statistics for key variables, including:

      ÔÇß	Total sales and average transaction value

      ÔÇß	Number of transactions per month

      ÔÇß	Distribution of purchases by product category

      ÔÇß	Average quantity purchased per transaction


3-	üìä **Data Visualization Tableau**

  o	Create visual representations to illustrate findings:

      ÔÇß	Time series graphs showing sales trends over the year.

      ÔÇß	Bar charts displaying the most popular product categories.

      ÔÇß	Pie charts representing the share of different payment methods.

      ÔÇß	Heatmaps of sales by location and time of day.
      



4-	üîç **Customer Segmentation:**

  o	Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior (e.g., high-frequency vs. low-frequency buyers).

  o	Analyze the purchasing patterns of different segments.


5- üìà **Insights and Findings:**

  o	Summarize the insights derived from the analysis, highlighting:

      ÔÇß	Peak shopping periods (e.g., holidays, weekends)

      ÔÇß	Trends in product category sales over time

      ÔÇß	Preferences in payment methods across customer segments


6-	üöÄ **Recommendations:**

  o	Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings to inform inventory management, targeted marketing campaigns, and promotional strategies.


7- üìÇ**Deliverables:**

    ‚Ä¢	A detailed report summarizing the methods, findings, and recommendations.

    ‚Ä¢	Visualizations and dashboards to present key insights clearly.

    ‚Ä¢	A presentation for stakeholders to communicate important findings and suggestions for future action.

This descriptive analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer purchase behaviors, enabling XYZ Retail to optimize its operations and enhance customer satisfaction.


# 2) Data-Analytics-Projects:

#Project completed in Udacity platform

Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data,
uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency
in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .



## Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis

Subjects Covered:
* Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
* Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application 
* Data Analysis Process
* NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
* Pandas Series and Dataframes


### Project 1:  Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions 
about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report. In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated
datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question 
and finishing by sharing the findings. 

### Project 2: Data Analysis with No-show Movie appointments

### Project 3: Data Analysis with-ncis-and-census-data


## Part 2 -Practical Statistics 

Subjects Covered:
* Probability
* Conditional Probability
* Binominal Distribution
* Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
* Descriptive Statistics
* Inferential Statistics
* Confidence Levels and Intervals
* Hypothesis Testing
* T-tests and A/B test
* Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression

### Project 4: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv 
Using Python, I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.I documented the wrangling 
efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.By using AB Testing and
regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one. 



## Part 3 - Data Extraction and Wrangling

Subjects Covered:
* GATHERING DATA: 
   * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, 
     and accessing data from APIs
   * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
   * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
* ASSESSING DATA 
   * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
   * Distinguish between dirty data (content or ‚Äúquality‚Äù issues) and messy data (structural or ‚Äútidiness‚Äù issues)
   * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
* CLEANING DATA 
   * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
   * Clean data using Python and pandas
   * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python
   
### Project 5 : Case Study in Data Wrangling.
I divide this project in three parts such as Gathering Data, Assessing Data, Cleaning Data. Dataset which i used in 
this project is really very messy. So first figure out what are the problem with dataset after that i found that the 
dataset have three major problem. First it has missing value, second is its Untidy dataset and third is quality issues.
I clean this data step by step. In the end i am able to remove all problem associated with the data set. Now i have clean
data. I perform all the cleaning operation in jupyter notebook using pandas and numpy.

### Project 6 :  Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding 
insights later. 


## Part 4 - Data Visualization

Subjects Covered:
* Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales ) 
* Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
* Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
* Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data ,  polish plots , create slide deck ) 

### Project 7: Data Visulization with Diamond Data 
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

### Project 8: Data Visualization with Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Python‚Äôs data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.

### Project 9: Data Visualization with Prosper Loan data.











Describe potential future work or extensions of the project. This could include additional analyses, improved methodologies, or incorporating more data.
